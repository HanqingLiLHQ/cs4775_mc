5. Brief project description (minimum 100 words):

	Over the decades, next-generation sequencing techniques have been used to produce  large DNA datasets containing millions of DNA tags. To understand the biological context of the sequencing results, bioinformaticians have developed numerous algorithms for motif discovery and clustering. In this project, we will compare between three different approaches regarding their clustering results on a TF-binding ChIP dataset. Specifically, we will implement motif clustering algorithms based on HMM, Bayesian statistics, and phylogenetics tree. 
	The HMM algorithm, Hammock1, was originally developed for peptide clustering. Here, we will apply this towards DNA sequence data. Hammock’s main framework was to initialize small clusters, extend each cluster based their profile HMM, merge clusters. The second and third step are conducted repeatedly. 
	While the Hammock paper applied HMM-HMM similarity measurement in merging clusters, we might also compute the similarity between motif clusters using Bayesian approaches2. Continuously computing pair-wise similarity score and merging highly similar motifs would finally generalize all the motifs into a phylogenetic tree, which is suited for clustering. 
	The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is included in this course. Applying unsupervised learning to EM can extends EM for discovering new motifs in a set of biopolymer
sequences where little or nothing is known in about any motifs( even unaligned). It is interesting to compare the results from using unsupervised learning on unaligned subsequences and using EM on known sequences.
	We have also learned other tree construction algorithms in our class, and each tree could be further processed into clusters of motifs3. It would also be interesting to compare different clustering results derived from different tree construction algorithms.
