# Distance-Based Clustering Project

This project provides Jupyter Notebooks for performing hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering on various biological datasets. It also includes python files to run (HMM) clustering, visualization of clusters, and distance calculations.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks, ensure that you have Jupyter installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HanqingLiLHQ/cs4775_mc
cd cs4775_mc
```

Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the desired notebook in the Jupyter Notebook interface that opens in your browser.

## Notebooks

### `distance_based_clustering.ipynb`

Use this notebook to run hierarchical and k-means clustering on the following datasets:
- Gapped vertebrates
- fungi_large
- fungi
- vertebrates_large

Each dataset has a dedicated code block. To switch between hierarchical and k-means clustering, comment out the code for the clustering algorithm you do not want to use, and uncomment the one you do.

### `hmm_clustering.ipynb`

Use this notebook to perform HMM clustering specifically on the `fungi` dataset.

### `cluster_graph.ipynb`

This notebook is used for visualizing the clusters formed by the clustering algorithms. Open it after running one of the clustering notebooks to see the graphical representation of clusters.

### `motif_distance.ipynb`

Run distance calculations using this notebook. It contains the necessary functions and code blocks to process the datasets and compute distances.

## Usage

To use a notebook, simply open it in the Jupyter interface and run the cells in order. Adjust the code blocks for clustering as per the instructions in the notebook to perform different types of clustering.

This README provides an overview of what each notebook does and how to use them, along with setup instructions.
1. The main file to run the algorithm is distance_based_clustering.ipynb and hmm_clustering.py. You can run all four datasets in distance_based_clustering.ipynb, while you can only run the fungi dataset in hmm_clustering.py. It takes a lot of time to calculate the distance matrix of the vertebrate large dataset.

2. All datasets are in the dataset folder.

3. The k-medoid clustering based on hierarhical clustering is in the kmeans_hier_init.py. The classic k-medoid clustering is in the kmeans_self_defined_dist. The hierarchical clustering is in hierarchical_clustering.py.

4. All distance methods is in column_distance.py

5. ALl evaluation: Scoring and Visualization helper funtions is in the evaluate folder.

6. If you generate logos of the motifs, they will be in the folder of this project. Folders named nature clusters are correct clustering. Folders named predicted clusters are the clustering result generated by the algorithm.

The jupyter notebook "motif_distance.ipynb" was used to plot and compare different alignment methods and distance functions. Specific motifs were fetched from JASPAR, including similar ones, dissimilar ones, and gapped ones with different gap lengths. Among the functions implemented, "compare_distance" compares different position-wise distance calculation methods (used to plot figure 3 and 4 by comparing fetched motifs ppm1 and ppm2, ppm1 and ppm3, gapped_ppm1 and gapped_ppm2). "compare_align" compares the overlap and expand strategy for motif alignment, giving rise to figure 2 by comparing ppm1 and ppm2, ppm1 and ppm3.
