1 The main file to run the algorithm is distance_based_clustering.ipynb and hmm_clustering.py. You can run all four datasets in distance_based_clustering.ipynb, while you can only run the fungi dataset in hmm_clustering.py. It takes a lot of time to calculate the distance matrix of the vertebrate large dataset.

2 All datasets are in the dataset folder.

3 The k-medoid clustering based on hierarhical clustering is in the kmeans_hier_init.py. The classic k-medoid clustering is in the kmeans_self_defined_dist.

4 All distance methods is in column_distance.py

5 ALl scoring and evaluation helper funtions is in the evaluate folder.

6 If you generate logos of the motifs, they will be in the folder of this project. Folders named nature clusters are correct clustering. Folders named predicted clusters are the clustering result generated by the algorithm.
